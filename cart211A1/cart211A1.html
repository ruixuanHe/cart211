				<p id="selfDescription">My name is Ruixuan He. A normal young man who has an ordinary life. I log in to this land at three years ago. Before that, I had live in a warm city in China for 18 years. At here, a brand new environment, I saw a lot of new things. The most shocking thing is the Canadian winter, -41 degree can freeze my asX in one second, even double pants can not save my trembling legs. And I think I was curved; my cotton socks always get lost. Or maybe my washing machine is too hungry. To be honest, I<span> HATE</span> winter except skiiiiiiii :/\</p>
