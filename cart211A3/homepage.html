  <p>Recently, eSports has gone through tremendous growth, incurring a significant increase in both viewership and prize money. Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments have increased significantly, going from about ten tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010. Moreover, esports has been featured alongside traditional sports in multinational events, and the International Olympic Committee has explored incorporating them into future Olympic events.
