  <section class="yesP" id="yes">This will obviously vary between different games, and different players, but looking at League of Legends, the most popular and successful team in North America, Team Solo Mid (TSM), practices, on average, about 10–12 hours a day. This might be a bit above average for the rest of the North American teams, but I would expect that this holds pretty close to true for most of them. If you head over to the Korean league, you see this number jump to about 12–14/day.</section>
